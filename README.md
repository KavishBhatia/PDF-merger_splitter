# PDF-merger_splitter
A GUI interface for merging and splitting PDFs. Works on windows on python or you can use .exe file directly. Will also test on Linux


If you want to run the python files, then you will need two packages 
1. pip install easygui
2. pip install PyPDF2

Or else, you can just download the exe files and merger or split your PDFs offline.
